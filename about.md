Welcome to my blog about programming, primarily on OS X and iOS. I write about problems I encounter, interesting APIs I run into, or simply tips and tricks that I think are worth sharing.

## History
I have spent the last five years or so full time doing OS X/iOS programming, but originally came from the community of the open source desktop environment GNOME[^1] where I was developing and maintaining various pieces of software for roughly ten years. Being a maintainer of the native Mac port of the graphical application toolkit GTK+[^2] for a couple of years led me into the direction of Cocoa which finally got me hooked and is now my main development platform together with iOS.
