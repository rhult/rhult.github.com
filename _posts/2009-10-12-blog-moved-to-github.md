After trying out blogspot/blogger for a while, I realized it is not ideal for a code blog. <a href="http://simply-hacking.org">Micke</a> pointed me to the solution created by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a>, which looked perfect for my needs. Simple and very flexible, and since I sit all day in front of my terminal typing git commands, the work flow is also very familiar ;)

Tom's post about the motivation for creating Jekyll (the site generator used to power the blog) is spot on: <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html">Blogging Like a Hacker</a>.

So, I have moved over the posts from my <a href="http://rhult.blogspot.com/">old blog</a>, and new posts will only appear here. See you!
